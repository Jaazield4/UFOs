# UFOs

## Overview 
Create a table out of JavaScript data about UFO sightings including; date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and comments. Then continued to put the table in as an html format and have all the information transferred to a webpage. Using the app.js file we then created filters to go through the table and only provide the data the user is looking for. The filters included date, city, state, country, and shape. Using html, JavaScript, and CSS we were able to create a visually appealing website with a large set of data can be filtered so that the user may find what they're looking for quicker without needing to scroll through the entire table of data.

## Results
When first opening the webpage the amount of data displayed can be overwhelming as there is a lot of information available for one to go over. As you can see in the picture below that going through the entire table to find a UFO sighting that you find relevant could take quite some time if you had to scroll through the entire table.

Because we inputted filters using the app.js file, users will now be able to find the information they are looking for much quicker. If a person was interested in only looking at the UFO sightings in Texas, they could simply type "tx" into the state filter box and find all the information they are looking for without scrolling through the entire table. As you can see below by filtering to only include UFO sightings in tx our table was trimmed to the 4 sightings we are interested in taking a closer look at.

The more we filter the more the results we get will be exactly what we are looking for. For example if we only want the UFO sighting that happened in Texas on the date January 8, 2010 we simply need to type "tx" into the state filter and "1/8/10" into the date filter. Below you can see that this has provided us with the two results from a large table that we (the user) is interested in taking a closer look at.

## Summary
All of the data that is included on this "The Truth is Out There" website comes from a data JavaScript file. This means that no new data will be inputted into the website without manually adjusting the data file in JavaScript. One way to fix this is to include a scraping button that will scrape for new data about UFO sightings from other sights and include them on our website. Another way would be to include a form on our webpage where users can add their UFO sightings date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and comments, and have that data be uploaded to the table.
